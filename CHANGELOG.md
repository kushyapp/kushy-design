# v0.0.0 (July 24, 2018)

## Project setup

* Installed semantic-ui-react as peer dependency. Allows us to use it here without cloning the repo and keeping it up to date, and allows use of those base SUI components easily in the other project as well.
* Installed semantic-ui with default configurations.
* Imported Kushy theme (`semantic/src/themes/kushy-v1`) from Kushy frontend and changed `theme.config` to use it instead of the default.
* Ran initial gulp build of SUI CSS/JS
* Added README + basic instructions.
* [Published to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kushy-design)
